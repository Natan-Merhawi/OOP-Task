                   Implicit and Explicit Conversion

>Implicit Conversion (also called automatic type conversion) happens
 when the compiler automatically converts one data type to another.
  This occurs when there is no risk of data loss, like converting an 
  "int" to a "double" because a "double" can hold more information.

>Explicit Conversion (also called type casting) is when the programmer
manually converts one data type to another. This is done when there is
a potential for data loss, like converting a "double" to an "int". 
You must use a cast operator to do this, as itâ€™s not automatic.
